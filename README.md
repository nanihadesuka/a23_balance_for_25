## About
0 A.D. alpha 23b balance for alpha 25.

Mostly all the stats of the units, buildings, techs should be correct but might have slipped some.

Art remains intact, only templates and techs are modified.

Some units from alpha24 will remain as they don't really change much the game balance.

## Known problems

One BIG thing missing is having the units pathfinder behave as in alpha 23b, currently they overlap each other. This is very bad because it can change drastically the effective "stats" of the units and thus stategies, making all these changes useless. Need to find a way to fix this issue, probably there is an option hidden somewhere for it.

## Installation
Is a normal mod, just install the pyromod of zip from the releases section.

## Compatibilities
Changes the simulation, not comptaible with vanilla.
